# scEP - predicting cell population-specific gene expression levels

We present scEP: a method that predicts gene expression at an unprecedented resolution using single-cell RNA-sequencing data. Using this GitHub, you can reproduce the figures from the preprint **add link**, train your own models, or look at the predicted effect of interesting variants. 

The results, trained models, input sequences etc. can all be downloaded from Zenodo (**add link**).

### Code
This folder contains the code to train your own models. Python version 3.6 or higher and PyTorch version 1.9 or higher is required for this.

### Tutorials
Here, we explain step-by-step how to train your own models and look at interesting variants or apply in-silico mutagenesis.

### Figures
Contains Jupyter Notebooks to reproduce all the figures from the preprint.
